## DESCRIPTION
A Ruby client for the ProfitBricks API.

## Dependencies
A Ruby interpreter (MRI 1.9.2/1.9.3/2.0.0, JRuby 1.8/1.9 and Rubinius 1.8/1.9).

To get the SSL certificate verification on JRuby 1.9 to work (at least on ubuntu/debian) export the following environment variable:

	export SSL_CERT_DIR=/etc/ssl/certs

## Installation
	gem install profitbricks


## Synopsis
	require 'profitbricks'
	Profitbricks.configure do |config|
		config.username = "username"
		config.password = "password"
	end

Get a list of all your Datacenters

	DataCenter.all

Create a new Datacenter

	dc = DataCenter.create(:name => 'Name')

Find a Datacenter by name

	dc = DataCenter.find(:name => 'Name')

Create a new Server

	dc.create_server(:cores => 1, :ram => 256, :name => 'Test Server')

or

	Server.create(:cores => 1, :ram => 256, :name => 'Test Server')

Check out the examples directory for more detailed usage information, or have a look at the [documentation](http://rubydoc.info/github/dsander/profitbricks/master/frames) for the class reference.

## CLI

To use the profitbricks binary you first have to store your username and password in environment variables
 	
 	export PROFITBRICKS_USER=yourusername
 	export PROFITBRICKS_PASSWORD=yourpassword

The binary always takes at least two arguments. The first represents a class name (in snake- or camel-case) and the second a method name of this class.
Get a list of all your datacenters:
 	
 	profitbricks data_center all

The following arguments are coverted into a Hash and passed to the method, if you want to call instance methods you _have_ to provide the id of the Server/DataCenter, etc:
 	
 	profitbricks server update id=03h17g46-3040-d1af-bb01-9579fe0300e7 cores=2 ram=1024
